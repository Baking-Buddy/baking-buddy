# Baking-Buddy

Letting the at-home baker provide to the neighborhood and beyond!

The previous year had people spend more time at home cultivating and improving skills, one of the common ones being baking. What if those bakers had a focused platform to connect with other bakers and potential clients. Given that, we are happy to introduce Baking Buddy, a full-stack application that allows users to discuss order details with customers, communicate with other bakers, provide reviews and feedback, along with maintaining their inventory, all on a site that is easy to use and navigate.
